# DeepSparse Logging

You can use DeepSparse logging to monitor your deployment. DeepSparse has capabilities to support MLOps-related monitoring. Examples include:

- **System logging** to monitor granular request latency data with Prometheus and Grafana
- **Data logging** to log input and output data (and projections thereof) for use with data drift detection or retraining

There are many types of monitoring tasks that you may want to perform to confirm your production system is working correctly. The difficulty of the tasks varies from relatively easy (simple system performance analysis) to challenging (assessing the accuracy of the system in the wild by manually labeling the input data distribution post-factum). Examples include:

- System performance: What is the latency/throughput of a query?
- Data quality: Is there an issue getting data to my model?
- Data distribution shift: Does the input data distribution deviate over time to the point where the model stops delivering reliable predictions?
- Model accuracy: What is the percentage of correct predictions that a model achieves?

DeepSparse logging is designed to provide maximum flexibility for you to extract whatever data is needed from a production inference pipeline into the logging system of your choice.

## Requirements

DeepSparse logging requires that [DeepSparse Server is installaed](/installation-guides/product-suite-installation/deepsparse).

## Metrics

DeepSparse logging provides access to two types of metrics:

- System logging
- Data logging

### System Logging Metrics

System logging gives you access to granular performance metrics for quick and efficient diagnosis of system health.

One group of system logging metrics currently is available: inference latency. For each inference request, DeepSparse Server logs the following:

- Pre-processing time—seconds in the pre-processing step
- Engine time—seconds in the engine forward pass step
- Post-processing time—seconds in the post-processing step
- Total time—second for the end-to-end response time (sum of the prior three)

### Data Logging Metrics

Data logging gives you access to data at each stage of an inference pipeline. This facilitates inspection of the data, understanding of its properties, detecting edge cases, and possible data drift.

There are four stages in the inference pipeline where data logging can occur:

- `pipeline_inputs`—raw input passed to the inference pipeline by the user
- `engine_inputs`—pre-processed tensors passed to the engine for the forward pass
- `engine_outputs`—result of the engine forward pass (for example, the raw logits)
- `pipeline_outputs`—final output returned to the pipeline caller

At each stage, you can specify functions to be applied to the data before logging. Example functions include the identity function (for logging the raw input/output) or the mean function (for example, for monitoring the mean pixel value of an image).

There are three types of functions that can be applied to target data at each stage:

- Built-in functions—pre-written functions provided by DeepSparse
- Framework functions—functions from Torch or numpy
- Custom functions—custom user-provided functions

## Configuration

The YAML-based server configuration file is used to configure both system and data logging.

- System logging is enabled by default. If no logger is specified, Python Logger is used.
- Data logging is disabled by default. The configuration allows you to specify what data to log.

See the [Deploying With DeepSparse Server Guide](/user-guides/deploying-deepsparse/deepsparse-server) for more details on the Server configuration file.

### Logging YAML Syntax

There are two key elements that should be added to the Server configuration to set up logging.

- **`loggers`** This element configures the loggers that are used by the Server. Each element is a dictionary of the form `{logger_name: {arg_1: arg_value}}`.

- **`data_logging`** This element identifies which/how data should be logged for an endpoint. It is a dictionary of the form `{identifier: `[log_config]}`.

    - **`identifier`** specifies the stages where logging should occur. It can either be a pipeline `stage` (see <em>Stages</em> above) or `stage.property` if the data type at a particular stage has a property. If the data type at a `stage` is a dictionary or list, you can access via slicing, indexing, or dictionary access (for example `stage[0][:,:,0]['key3']`).

  - **`log_config`** specifies which function to apply, which logger(s) to use, and how often to log. It is a dictionary of the form `{func: name, frequency: freq, target_loggers: [logger_names]}`.

### Tangible Example

Here is an example for an image classification server:

```yaml
# example-config.yaml
loggers:
  python:         # logs to stdout
  prometheus:     # logs to prometheus on port 6100
    port: 6100

endpoints:
  - task: image_classification
    route: /image_classification/predict
    model: zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned95_quant-none
    data_logging:
      pipeline_inputs.images:   # applies to the images (of the form stage.property)
        - func: np.shape        # framework function
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - python

      pipeline_inputs.images[0]:          # applies to the first image (of the form stage.property[idx])
        - func: mean_pixels_per_channel   # built-in function
          frequency: 2
          target_loggers:
            - python
        - func: fraction_zeros  # built-in function
          frequency: 2
          target_loggers:
            - prometheus

      engine_inputs:            # applies to the engine_inputs data (of the form stage)
        - func: np.shape        # framework function
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - python
```

This configuration does the following data logging at each respective stage of the pipeline:

- Enables system logging by default and logs to Prometheus and StdOut
- Logs the shape of the input batch provided by the user to stdout
- Logs the mean pixels and % of 0 pixels of the first image in the batch to Prometheus
- Logs the raw data and shape of the input passed to the engine to Python
- Does not log at any other pipeline stages

## Loggers

DeepSparse logging includes options to log to standard output and Prometheus (out of the box) as well as the ability to create a custom logger.

### Python Logger

Python Logger logs data to standard output. It is useful for debugging and inspecting an inference pipeline. It accepts no arguments and is configured with the following:

```yaml
loggers:
  python:
```

### Prometheus Logger

DeepSparse is integrated with Prometheus, enabling you to easily instrument your model service. The Prometheus logger accepts some optional arguments and is configured as:

```yaml
loggers:
  prometheus:
    port: 6100
    text_log_save_frequency: 10             # optional
    text_log_save_dir: text/log/save/dir    # optional
    text_log_file_name: text_log_file_name  # optional
```

There are four types of metrics in Prometheus (Counter, Gauge, Summary, and Histogram). DeepSparse uses [Summary](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#summary) (<em>under the hood</em>) to make sure the data you are logging to Prometheus is an Int or a Float.

### Custom Logger

If you need a custom logger, you can create a class that inherits from the `BaseLogger` and implements the `log` method. The `log` method is called at each pipeline stage and should handle exposing the metric to the logger.

```python
from deepsparse.loggers import BaseLogger
from typing import Any, Optional

class CustomLogger(BaseLogger):
    def log(self, identifier: str, value: Any, category: Optional[str]=None):
        """
        :param identifier: The name of the item that is being logged.
            By default, in the simplest case, that would be a string in the form
            of "<pipeline_name>/<logging_target>"
            e.g. "image_classification/pipeline_inputs"
        :param value: The item that is logged along with the identifier
        :param category: The metric category that the log belongs to.
            By default, we recommend sticking to our internal convention
            established in the MetricsCategories enum.
        """
        print("Logging from a custom logger")
        print(identifier)
        print(value)
```

Once a custom logger is implemented, it can be referenced from a configuration file:

```yaml
# server-config-with-custom-logger.yaml
loggers:
  custom_logger:
    path: example_custom_logger.py:CustomLogger
    # arg_1: your_arg_1

endpoints:
  - task: sentiment_analysis
    route: /sentiment_analysis/predict
    model: zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni
    name: sentiment_analysis_pipeline
    data_logging:
      pipeline_inputs:
        - func: identity
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - custom_logger
```

Download the following for an example of a custom logger:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/docs/rs/embedding-extraction-feature/files-for-examples/user-guide/deepsparse/logging/example_custom_logger.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/docs/rs/embedding-extraction-feature/files-for-examples/user-guide/deepsparse/logging/server-config-with-custom-logger.yaml
```

Launch the server:

```bash
deepsparse.server --config-file server-config-with-custom-logger.yaml
```

Submit a request:

```python
import requests
url = "http://0.0.0.0:5543/sentiment_analysis/predict"
obj = {"sequences": "Snorlax loves my Tesla!"}
resp = requests.post(url=url, json=obj)
print(resp.text)
```

You should see data printed to the Server's standard output.

See the [Neural Magic Prometheus logger implementation](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/blob/main/src/deepsparse/loggers/prometheus_logger.py) for inspiration on implementing a logger.

## Usage

DeepSparse logging is currently supported for usage with DeepSparse Server.

### Server Usage

The Server startup CLI command accepts a YAML configuration file (which contains both logging-specific and general configuration details) via the `--config-file` argument.

Data logging is configured at the endpoint level. The configuration file below creates a Server with two endpoints (one for image classification and one for sentiment analysis):

```yaml
# server-config.yaml
loggers:
  python:
  prometheus:
    port: 6100

endpoints:
  - task: image_classification
    route: /image_classification/predict
    model: zoo:cv/classification/resnet_v1-50/pytorch/sparseml/imagenet/pruned95_quant-none
    name: image_classification_pipeline
    data_logging:
      pipeline_inputs.images:
        - func: np.shape
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - python

      pipeline_inputs.images[0]:
        - func: max_pixels_per_channel
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - python
        - func: mean_pixels_per_channel
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - python
        - func: fraction_zeros
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - prometheus

      pipeline_outputs.scores[0]:
        - func: identity
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - prometheus

  - task: sentiment_analysis
    route: /sentiment_analysis/predict
    model: zoo:nlp/sentiment_analysis/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/sst2/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni
    name: sentiment_analysis_pipeline
    data_logging:
      engine_inputs:
        - func: example_custom_fn.py:sequence_length
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - python
            - prometheus

      pipeline_outputs.scores[0]:
        - func: identity
          frequency: 1
          target_loggers:
            - python
            - prometheus
```

### Custom Data Logging Function
The example above included a custom function for computing sequence lengths. Custom Functions should be defined in a local Python file. They should accept one argument and return a single output.

The `example_custom_fn.py` file could look like the following:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List

# Engine inputs to transformers is 3 lists of np.arrays representing
# the encoded input, the attention mask, and token types.
# Each of the np.arrays is of shape (batch, max_seq_len), so
# engine_inputs[0][0] gives the encodings of the first item in the batch.
# The number of non-zeros in this slice is the sequence length.
def sequence_length(engine_inputs: List[np.ndarray]):
  return np.count_nonzero(engine_inputs[0][0])
```

### Launching the Server and Logging Metrics

Download the `server-config.yaml`, `example_custom_fn.py`, and `goldfish.jpeg` for the demo.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/docs/rs/embedding-extraction-feature/files-for-examples/user-guide/deepsparse/logging/server-config.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/docs/rs/embedding-extraction-feature/files-for-examples/user-guide/deepsparse/logging/example_custom_fn.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralmagic/docs/rs/embedding-extraction-feature/files-for-examples/user-guide/deepsparse/logging/goldfish.jpg

```

Launch the Server with the following:

```bash
deepsparse.server --config-file server-config.yaml
```

Submit a request to the image classification endpoint.

```python
import requests
url = "http://0.0.0.0:5543/image_classification/predict/from_files"
paths = ["goldfish.jpg"]
files = [("request", open(img, 'rb')) for img in paths]
resp = requests.post(url=url, files=files)
print(resp.text)
```

Submit a request to the sentiment analysis endpoint with the following:

```python
import requests
url = "http://0.0.0.0:5543/sentiment_analysis/predict"
obj = {"sequences": "Snorlax loves my Tesla!"}
resp = requests.post(url=url, json=obj)
print(resp.text)
```
You should see the metrics logged to the Server's standard output and to Prometheus. (See at `http://localhost:6100` to quickly inspect the exposed metrics.)
