# Try a Model

DeepSparse Engine supports fast inference on CPUs for sparse and dense models. For sparse models in particular, it achieves GPU-level performance in many use cases.

Around the engine, the DeepSparse package includes various utilities to simplify benchmarking performance and model deployment. For instance:
1. Trained models are passed in the open ONNX file format, enabling easy exporting from common packages like PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow.
2. Benchmaking latency and performance is available via a single CLI call, with various arguments to test scenarios.
3. `Pipelines` utilities wrap the model execution with input pre-processing and output post-processing, simplifying deployment and adding functionality like multi-stream, bucketing and dynamic shape.

## Use Case Examples
