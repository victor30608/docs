# Transfer a Sparsified Model

Sparse transfer learning is the easiest pathway for creating a sparse model fine-tuned on your datasets.

Sparse transfer learning works by taking a sparse model pre-trained on a large dataset and fine-tuning it onto a smaller downstream dataset.
SparseZoo and SparseML work together to accomplish this goal:
- SparseZoo is a growing repository of sparse models pre-trained on large datasets ready for fine-tuning.
- SparseML contains convenient training CLIs that run transfer-learn while preserving the same level of sparsity as the starting model.

By fine-tuning pre-sparsified models onto your dataset, you can avoid the time, money, and hyperparameter tuning involved with sparsifying a dense model from scratch.
Once trained, deploy your model on the DeepSparse Engine for GPU-level performance on CPUs.
