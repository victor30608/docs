# SparseML

## Requirements

SparseML is tested on Python 3.7-3.10 and is limited to Linux and MacOS systems. Currently supported ML frameworks are:

- PyTorch >= 1.1.0 and <= 2.0
    Later PyTorch versions are untested and have a known issue for exporting quantized models to ONNX graphs.

- TensorFlow >= 1.8.0 and < 2.0.0
    TensorFlow V1 is no longer being built for newer operating systems such as Ubuntu 20.04. Therefore, SparseML with TensorFlow V1 is also unsupported on these operating systems.

- TensorFlow Keras ~= 2.2.0
    Later Keras versions are untested and have known issues with exporting to ONNX.

## Installation

Install SparseML to apply SOTA sparsification algorithms to models easily. Installation is with PyPI:

```bash
pip install sparseml
```

Options:

**`[torch]`**—For integration with PyTorch, enter:

```bash
pip install sparseml[torch]
```

**`[torchvison]`**—To install PyTorch with torchvision, enter:

```bash
pip install sparseml[torch,torchvision]
```

**`[tf_v1]`**—For integration with TensorFlow, enter:

```bash
pip install sparseml[tf_v1]
```

Depending on your device and CUDA version, you may need to install [additional dependencies](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu#older_versions_of_tensorflow) for using TensorFlow V1 with GPU operations.

**`[tf_v1_gpu]`**—To install a GPU-compatible version of TensorFlow, enter:

```bash
pip install sparseml[tf_v1_gpu]
```

**`[tf_keras]`**—For integration with Keras, enter:

```bash
pip install sparseml[keras]
```
